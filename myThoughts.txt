Yo!

Big thanks for downloading this lil' thing I threw together for fun.

Honestly, I just wanted to make something that’s useful and... well, actually works!

Then I thought, "Aight, let’s throw in a GUI," even though I suck at that kinda thing. And yeah, one thing led to another and here we are.

Not exactly a wild story for a file called "MyThoughts," right? Hehe, well >:3 I wasn't planning to write like my entire life story for this lmfao 

To be real, this only took me like 2 days, so ain’t much to say anyway…

Random, but wanna hear something funny?
"How do you flirt as an African?"
"Yo baby, are you water? 'Cause I GENUINELY need you right now!"
THOSE WHO SNOW ❄️

... Yeah, I’ll just dip now.
